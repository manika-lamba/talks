# What is Topic Modeling? {background-color="#F7D9C4"}

## Definition

***Topic Modeling***

-   It is "a method for finding and tracing clusters of words (called *topics*) in large bodies of texts" (Brett)
-   It is a text mining approach to understand, organize, process, extract, manage, and summarize knowledge

***Topic***

-   It is "a recurring pattern of co-occurring words" (Brett)
-   A topic can be defined as the main idea discussed in a text, i.e., the theme or subject of different granularity
-   Topics are simply groups of words from the collection of documents that represents the information in the collection in the best way

## Introduction 

- It makes an excellent tool for discovery and helps to uncover evidence
already present in the text
- It has been called an act of reading tea leaves (Chang et al., 2009) or the process of highlighting words (Brett) based on their topics
- It is based on statistical and machine learning techniques to mine meaningful information from a vast corpus of unstructured data and is used to mine document’s content
- There are no machine-readable annotations that can tell the topic modeling programs about the semantic meaning of the words in the text


## What Happens in Topic Modeling?

- It infers abstract topics based on “similar patterns of word usage in each document”
- These topics are simply groups of words from the collection of documents that represents the information in the collection in the best way

## When to Use Topic Modeling

- When you have a vast collection of text documents
- When the collection belongs to a specific subject
- When the collection has a similar type of documents, such as when all files in the collection are newspaper articles

## When NOT to Use Topic Modeling
- When you have a relatively small number of documents
- When you do not have any idea about your collection. In this case, clustering will be a better option than using topic modeling
- When the collection has a mixture of different types of documents, such as when the collection is composed of newspaper archives, journal articles, and ETDs
