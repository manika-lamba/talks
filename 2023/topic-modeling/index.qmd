# What is Topic Modeling? {background-color="#F7D9C4"}

::: footer
:::

## Definition

::: incremental
::: incremental
***Topic***

-   It is "a recurring pattern of co-occurring words" (Brett)
-   A topic can be defined as the main idea discussed in a text, i.e., the theme or subject of different granularity
-   Topics are simply groups of words from the collection of documents that represents the information in the collection in the best way
:::

***Topic Modeling***

-   It is "a method for finding and tracing clusters of words (called *topics*) in large bodies of texts" (Brett)
-   It is a text mining approach to understand, organize, process, extract, manage, and summarize knowledge
:::

::: footer
:::

## Introduction

::: incremental
-   It performs *soft clustering*, where it presumes that every document is composed of a mixture of topics
-   It makes an excellent tool for discovery and helps to uncover evidence already present in the text
-   It has been called an act of reading tea leaves (Chang et al., 2009) or the process of highlighting words (Brett) based on their topics
-   It is based on statistical and machine learning techniques to mine meaningful information from a vast corpus of unstructured data and is used to mine document's content
-   There are no machine-readable annotations that can tell the topic modeling programs about the semantic meaning of the words in the text

## Some Important Concepts

## TDM

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
![](img/8.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
-   It represents terms as a table or matrix of numbers for a given corpus
-   In TDM, terms are represented as rows and documents as columns for a corpus where the number of occurrences of terms in the document is entered in the boxes
:::
:::

::: footer
:::

## DTM

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
![](img/9.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
-   It represents terms as a table or matrix of numbers for a given corpus
-   It is a transposition of TDM
-   In DTM, each document is a row, and each word is the column
:::
:::

::: footer
:::

## TF-IDF

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
![](img/10.jpg){fig-align="center"}

It evaluates the relevancy of a term for a document in a corpus and is the most popular weighting scheme in information retrieval (IR)
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
-   The term **weighting** is popularly used in IR and supervised machine learning tasks like text classification
-   It makes a list of more discriminative terms than others and assigns a weight to each highly occurring term
:::

## What Happens in Topic Modeling?

![](img/background.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="65%"}

-   It infers abstract topics based on "similar patterns of word usage in each document"
-   These topics are simply groups of words from the collection of documents that represents the information in the collection in the best way

## Topic Analysis + Time

::: incremental
-   It assists in identifying topics within a context and how they advance in time
-   For instance, over time, few documents within a topic may initiate content that varies from the original content; If that initiated content is shared by a lot of later documents, the content is recognized as a new topic
-   Hence, with the progression of time, topics advance, new themes emerge, and old ones become obsolete
-   So, topic modeling not just helps the researchers to decide the trending topics or related fields to their field of intrigue but additionally encourages them to distinguish new concepts and fields over time
:::

## How to DO Topic Modeling?

::: incremental
1.  Extract/Retrieve/Prepare dataset (e.g. webscraping, API, etc.)
2.  Preparing a corpus (such as converting files from PDF to plain text format)
3.  Conducting text pre-processing (removing, stopwords, tokenization, stemming, n-grams)
4.  Exploratory analysis (Word clouds, clustering)\
5.  Determining the number of topics (using perplexity, coherence, entropy, or eye-ball method)
6.  Selecting the appropriate algorithm (such as LDA, STM, CTM)
7.  Seeding (so that one can reproduce the algorithm with the same selected parameters)
8.  Running the selected algorithm using proprietary or open-source tools (such as RapidMiner, TopicModelingTool) or programming languages (such as R or Python)
9.  Iterating the whole process till the algorithm fits the model
:::

::: footer
:::

## When to Use Topic Modeling

::: incremental
-   When you have a vast collection of text documents
-   When the collection belongs to a specific subject
-   When the collection has a similar type of documents, such as when all files in the collection are newspaper articles
:::

::: footer
:::

## When NOT to Use Topic Modeling

::: incremental
-   When you have a relatively small number of documents
-   When you do not have any idea about your collection. In this case, clustering will be a better option than using topic modeling
-   When the collection has a mixture of different types of documents, such as when the collection is composed of newspaper archives, journal articles, and ETDs

## Topic Visualization

-   Open questions:

1.  How we use the output of the algorithm?
2.  How should we visualize and navigate the topical structure?
3.  What do the topics and document representations tell us about the texts?

-   Output of topic modeling is not entirely human-readable, and one way to understand the results is through visualization
-   "Topic models are meant to help interpret and understand texts, but it is still the researcher's job to do the actual interpreting and understanding" (Blei, 2012)
-   "But be sure that you can understand the visualization as topic modeling tools are fallible" (Blei, 2012)

## Use Cases

**1. Making Ontologies**: Mehler and Walitinger used topic modeling to build a Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC)-based topic classification model in digital libraries

**2. Automatic Subject Classification**: They can be
used in libraries to index subject terms for documents

**3. Recommendation Service**: It can be used to recommend electronic resources based on the reading or search habits of the users

**4. Bibliometrics**: It can be used to study evolutionary pathways, citations, and trends to explore
different hot and cold topics of research in a particular discipline

**5. Altmetrics**: It can be used to know what people are talking about your library on social media and
what topics they care about

## Use Cases (Cont.)

**6. Organizatuon and Management of Reseource**: It can be used to do metadata tagging of the electronic resources, library’s database, website, and repository resources

**7. Better Searching and Information Retrieval of Resources**: In digital libraries, it can help in providing a fast searching experience to users and better information retrieval of electronic resources

# Class Activity {background-color="#F7D9C4"}

1. Find atleast 15-20 book reviews/journal articles/email data/twitter posts, etc.  (Make sure they have an "Abstract/any kind of text"! More the data, better will be the results!)
2. Save your results in a CSV file. 
3. Go to [https://www.coconut-libtool.com/](https://www.coconut-libtool.com/), and choose "Topic Modeling" in the left panel
4. Upload your file
5. Choose the parameters of your choice and record it
6. Save the visualization 
7. Post your visualization, your parameters (algorithm, number of topics chosen, etc.) on the discussion board and discuss what kind of data you did topic modeling on and what does your results show
